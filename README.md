nvmimic is a copy of [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) written in Rust. nvm
is the tool many people use to install Node and switch between Node versions.
nvmimic aims to behave exactly like nvm, so a script that uses nvm can't tell
the difference. Same commands, same output, same exit codes, same files on disk.

## Why it exists

nvm is a big shell script. Your shell runs it every time a new terminal opens,
and that takes a noticeable amount of time. On one test machine, opening a
shell with nvm took about 170ms in bash and about 400ms in zsh. Most of that
time goes into starting dozens of small helper programs.

nvmimic keeps only a tiny piece in your shell. That piece passes your `nvm`
commands to one fast program, so a new shell barely notices it.

## Status

Early work. nvmimic doesn't do anything useful yet. The first version it
copies is nvm 0.40.8.

## License

MIT, the same license as nvm. Parts of nvmimic are ported from nvm, so nvm's
copyright notice sits next to ours in [LICENSE](LICENSE).
